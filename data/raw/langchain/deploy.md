# LangSmith Deployment

Copy page

When you’re ready to deploy your LangChain agent to production, LangSmith provides a managed hosting platform designed for agent workloads. Traditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web applications, while LangGraph is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents** that require persistent state and background execution. LangSmith handles the infrastructure, scaling, and operational concerns so you can deploy directly from your repository.

## ​ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A GitHub account
* A LangSmith account (free to sign up)

## ​ Deploy your agent

### ​ 1. Create a repository on GitHub

Your application’s code must reside in a GitHub repository to be deployed on LangSmith. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, first make sure your app is LangGraph-compatible by following the local server setup guide. Then, push your code to the repository.

### ​ 2. Deploy to LangSmith

1

Navigate to LangSmith Deployment

Log in to LangSmith. In the left sidebar, select **Deployments**.

2

Create new deployment

Click the **+ New Deployment** button. A pane will open where you can fill in the required fields.

3

Link repository

If you are a first time user or adding a private repository that has not been previously connected, click the **Add new account** button and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account.

4

Deploy repository

Select your application’s repository. Click **Submit** to deploy. This may take about 15 minutes to complete. You can check the status in the **Deployment details** view.

### ​ 3. Test your application in Studio

Once your application is deployed:

1. Select the deployment you just created to view more details.
2. Click the **Studio** button in the top right corner. Studio will open to display your graph.

### ​ 4. Get the API URL for your deployment

1. In the **Deployment details** view in LangGraph, click the **API URL** to copy it to your clipboard.
2. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.

### ​ 5. Test the API

You can now test the API:

* Python
* Rest API

1. Install LangGraph Python:

```
pip install langgraph-sdk
```

2. Send a message to the agent:

```
from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client # or get_client for async

client = get_sync_client(url="your-deployment-url", api_key="your-langsmith-api-key")

for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    None,    # Threadless run
    "agent", # Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.
    input={
        "messages": [{
            "role": "human",
            "content": "What is LangGraph?",
        }],
    },
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")
```

```
curl -s --request POST \
    --url <DEPLOYMENT_URL>/runs/stream \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header "X-Api-Key: <LANGSMITH API KEY> \
    --data "{
        \"assistant_id\": \"agent\", `# Name of agent. Defined in langgraph.json.`
        \"input\": {
            \"messages\": [
                {
                    \"role\": \"human\",
                    \"content\": \"What is LangGraph?\"
                }
            ]
        },
        \"stream_mode\": \"updates\"
    }"
```

LangSmith offers additional hosting options, including self-hosted and hybrid. For more information, please see the Platform setup overview.
